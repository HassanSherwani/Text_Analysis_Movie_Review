Kaggle challenge-UMICH SI650 - Sentiment Classification

This is a text classification task - sentiment classification. Every document (a line in the data file) is a sentence extracted from social media (blogs). Your goal is to classify the sentiment of each sentence into "positive" or "negative". 

The training data contains 7086 sentences, already labeled with 1 (positive sentiment) or 0 (negative sentiment). The test data contains 33052 sentences that are unlabeled. The submission should be a .txt file with 33052 lines. In each line, there should be exactly one integer, 0 or 1, according to your classification results. 

You can make 5 submissions per day. Once you submit your results, you will get an accuracy score computed based on 20% of the test data. This score will position you somewhere on the leaderboard. Once the competition ends, you will see the final accuracy computed based on 100% of the test data. The evaluation metric is the inverse of the the mis-classification error - so the higher the better.   

You can use any classifiers, any features, and either supervised or semi-supervised methods. Be creative in both the methods and the usernames you select!
